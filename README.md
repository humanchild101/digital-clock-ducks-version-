# digital clock (with ducks)

This is a digital clock that will tell you the time in 5 different timezones including your own local time. You can change the timezone through the buttons and the background of the screen with the 'change color' button. 


However, there are also ducks. 

There are 2 varieties of ducks: the cute yellow ones and the mildly creepy ones. These ducks spawn on the screen at different times and you must click them to get rid of them. The cute ones spawn quicker while the creepy purple ones show up every 15 seconds. 

You can get rid of the cute ducks with just 1 click while the purple ones take 2 or 3 clicks (it iis randomized for each purple duck). Clicking the ducks may also prompt something to happen such as the background changing, the screen glitching, or the timezone changing. 

They will only keep spawning and will invade the pygame window if left for a while.


I've created 3 classes: Button, Duck, and SpriteSheets 

All art/animation frames for spritesheets were created by me. 

Thank you.
